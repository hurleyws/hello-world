# hello-world

# Love the tradition maintained in this culture. My name is Hurley and I'm a burgeoning computer-science hobbiest (something to do when I'm not working or streaming, I suppose). My background is process improvement and I specialize in healthcare. Interestingly enough, there are many of parallels between my trade and what I'm learning about the world of computing. Finding those parallels and increasing my understanding of computer science is my fuel for this.
